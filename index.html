        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Cloud File Manager! This application allows you to upload, view, and manage your files using Firebase Storage and Authentication, which are both part of Google's cloud services. By utilizing cloud network technology, this platform provides seamless, secure, and scalable storage for your files, accessible anytime and from anywhere.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>This project leverages cloud network services to provide users with secure and scalable file management. It uses Firebase, a powerful platform from Google, which offers cloud storage solutions, authentication, and real-time capabilities. The cloud infrastructure ensures that your files are stored remotely, eliminating the need for physical storage devices and allowing them to be easily accessible from any device with an internet connection. The cloud also enables enhanced collaboration, data redundancy, and backup capabilities, ensuring that your data is always safe and available.</p>
        <br><br>

        <h3>Benefits for Users</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure Storage:</strong> Your files are securely stored in the cloud, protected by advanced encryption methods and privacy protocols. Cloud networks have robust security measures, such as access control and data protection, which safeguard your data from unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Cloud networks make your files accessible from anywhere, anytime, and on any device that is connected to the internet. Whether you are at home, at work, or on the go, you can easily access your files.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalable:</strong> As your storage needs grow, the cloud automatically scales to accommodate more data. This scalability allows you to manage and store large volumes of data without worrying about running out of space.</li>
            <li><strong>Easy Management:</strong> With cloud-based file management, you can easily upload, view, organize, and manage your files from a user-friendly interface without the complexities of managing local storage systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Backup and Recovery:</strong> Cloud storage services automatically back up your files, ensuring that they are safe even in the event of device failure or data loss. Cloud networks provide redundancy across multiple servers and locations, meaning that your data is always recoverable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps I Take to Create the Cloud File Manager Project for Network Technology 2:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="step" data-step="1">
                <strong>Researching Cloud Networks:</strong>
                <div class="step-info">
                    <p>The first step in the project was to research the cloud storage technologies available, such as Firebase and other cloud platforms. This involved understanding the key concepts of cloud storage, data security, and scalability, ensuring the chosen platform would meet the project’s needs.</p>

                <strong>Designing the Project:</strong>
                <div class="step-info">
                    <p>Once the cloud platform was chosen (Firebase), the next step was designing the system architecture. This included deciding how the user interface should look, determining the flow of user interactions, and planning how the cloud storage, authentication, and file management features would work together seamlessly.</p>

                <strong>Coding the Project:</strong>
                <div class="step-info">
                    <p>After the design was completed, the development began. This included coding the user interface with HTML and CSS, and integrating Firebase using JavaScript. The main functionality, such as file upload, download, and deletion, was coded, as well as implementing Firebase Authentication for secure login.</p>
